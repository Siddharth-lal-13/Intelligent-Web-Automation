## Overview
The **Intelligent Web Automation & Data Extraction System** is a sophisticated tool developed between December 2024 and February 2025 to automate web interactions and extract actionable data with high precision. Leveraging SeleniumBase and BeautifulSoup for robust scraping, customized EasyOCR (CRNN-based) for optical character recognition, Vosk for real-time audio transcription, and a suite of data analysis tools (OpenCV, NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib), this project demonstrates advanced automation and AI-driven data processing capabilities.

**Note**: This repository is a demo version of a private codebase, designed to showcase architecture and key functionalities without revealing proprietary implementations.

## Features
- **Web Automation & Scraping**: Utilizes SeleniumBase with PyAutoGUI for dynamic web interactions and BeautifulSoup for structured HTML parsing.
- **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**: Custom-tuned EasyOCR with a Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) backbone for high-accuracy text extraction from images.
- **Real-Time Transcription**: Integrates Vosk for efficient audio-to-text conversion, enabling real-time data capture.
- **Data Analysis & Visualization**: Employs OpenCV for image processing, NumPy for numerical operations, pandas for data structuring, and Matplotlib for insightful visualizations.
- **ETL Pipeline**: Combines extraction, transformation, and loading of diverse data sources into a unified system.

## Architecture
This system follows a modular pipeline architecture:
- **Scraping Module**: `scraper.py` uses SeleniumBase to navigate websites and BeautifulSoup to extract structured data, with PyAutoGUI enhancing interaction fidelity.
- **OCR Module**: `ocr.py` preprocesses images with OpenCV and applies a tailored EasyOCR CRNN model for text extraction.
- **Transcription Module**: `transcription.py` leverages Vosk to convert audio streams into text in real time.
- **Analysis Module**: `analysis.py` integrates extracted data into a pandas DataFrame, processes it with NumPy, and generates visualizations via Matplotlib.
- **Main Script**: `main.py` orchestrates the workflow, ensuring seamless data flow across modules.

The design emphasizes modularity, allowing each component to function independently or as part of the full ETL pipeline.

## Limitations
- This demo simplifies proprietary implementations (e.g., custom CRNN tuning, full audio datasets).
- No live deployment or sample outputs are included due to the project’s private nature.
- Analysis outputs are simulated for illustrative purposes.

---

## Future Enhancements
- Integrate a database (e.g., SQLite) for persistent data storage.
- Optimize CRNN model for multilingual OCR support.
- Add parallel processing for faster scraping of large websites.
